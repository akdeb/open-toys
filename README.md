## ⚡️ Flash to ESP32

1. Connect your ESP32-S3 to your Apple Silicon Mac.
2. In OpenToys, go to `Settings` and click `Flash Firmware`.
3. OpenToys flashes bundled firmware images (`bootloader`, `partitions`, `firmware`) directly.
4. After flashing, the toy opens a WiFi captive portal (`ELATO`) for network setup.
5. Put your Mac and toy on the same WiFi network; the toy reconnects when powered on while OpenToys is running.
