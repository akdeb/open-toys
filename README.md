# 👾 OpenToys

Build your own Local AI Toys, Desk Companions, Robots and more with an ESP32. OpenToys runs fully on-device on Apple Silicon without sending your data to the cloud.


## 🤔 Why OpenToys?

- **Fully on-device**: No cloud, no subscriptions, no data leaving your home.
- **Multilingual**: OpenToys supports multiple languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese and more!
- **Voice Cloning**: Clone your own voice or your favorite characters with <10s of audio.
- **Customizable**: Build your own toys, companions, robots and more with an ESP32.
- **Open-source**: The community is open-source and free to use and contribute to.

## 💻 Core stack

- LLMs: any LLM from `mlx-community` (Qwen, Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- Platform focus: Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4...)
- Privacy model: local-first, works without internet (after setup/model downloads)

## 🔧 Local development setup

## ⚡️ Flash to ESP32

1. Connect your ESP32-S3 to your Apple Silicon Mac.
2. In OpenToys, go to `Settings` and click `Flash Firmware`.
3. OpenToys flashes bundled firmware images (`bootloader`, `partitions`, `firmware`) directly.
4. After flashing, the toy opens a WiFi captive portal (`ELATO`) for network setup.
5. Put your Mac and toy on the same WiFi network; the toy reconnects when powered on while OpenToys is running.
